# Encoder
This project is an assignment that is required by Coding Dojo - Prebootcamp activities.


"Write a function that takes in a phrase, encodes it, then returns the encoded phrase.
Each letter in the phrase needs to be moved 13 places back.
If the letter moves back past 'a' it should continue at the end of the alphabet.
Spaces should be ignored.
Get the user to input a phrase using an Edit Text View and a Button.
Pass the phrase into your function.
Print the result to the console.

Example: 
If the user enters 'Hi there',
The output should be 'uv gurer'.

Bonus:
Create a Text View that displays the output to the user."
